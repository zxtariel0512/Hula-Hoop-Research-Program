# Hula-Hoop-Research-Program
Analytical and Numerical Study on Hula-Hoop Dynamics and Levitation Condition May 2019 - current l Constructed a model of hula hoop motion based on Lagrangian Mechanics and implemented a simulation program in Matlab to solve the problem numerically l Used high speed camera video-tracking techniques to record and capture hoopâ€™s motion information at each millisecond, and implemented algorithms that analyzed 16050 frames to track the exact motion condition of hoop and body and to calculate the sagging angle of hoop l Implemented visualization program that recorded and reflected 25,000+ experiment video frame at real time l Concluded general conditions of hula hoop levitation in equilibrium and stability analysis in three dimension using Coriolis Force and Lagrangian optimization
